ESP Microcontroller Projects
Welcome to the ESP Microcontroller Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of projects developed using various ESP microcontrollers, including the popular ESP32, ESP8266, and ESP-H2.

Overview
ESP microcontrollers are a series of low-cost, low-power microcontrollers with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, making them ideal for IoT applications and embedded projects. This repository showcases projects developed using different ESP microcontrollers to demonstrate their capabilities and versatility.

Supported Microcontrollers
ESP32
The ESP32 is a powerful microcontroller with dual-core processors, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and a wide range of peripheral interfaces. Projects developed using the ESP32 demonstrate its ability to handle complex tasks and connect to various IoT devices and services.

ESP8266
The ESP8266 is a cost-effective Wi-Fi microcontroller with a single-core processor and integrated TCP/IP stack. Despite its lower processing power compared to the ESP32, projects developed using the ESP8266 showcase its ability to connect to Wi-Fi networks and interact with IoT devices.

ESP-H2
The ESP-H2 is a compact Wi-Fi microcontroller designed for IoT applications requiring low power consumption and small form factor. Projects developed using the ESP-H2 demonstrate its suitability for battery-powered and space-constrained embedded systems.
